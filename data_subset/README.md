# Data Subset Directory

This directory contains smaller subsets of the main data for development and testing purposes.

## Purpose

- Development-friendly data samples
- Quick testing with smaller datasets
- Performance benchmarking with known data sizes

## Usage

Place smaller versions of the main data files here for development work:
- `award_data.csv` (subset of main SBIR awards)
- Contract data samples

## Note

Subset data files are excluded from version control to keep repository size manageable.
