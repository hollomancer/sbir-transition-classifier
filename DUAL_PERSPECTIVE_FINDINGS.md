# Dual-Perspective SBIR Transition Analysis - Key Findings

## üéØ **Two Critical Success Metrics**

### **üìä Company-Level Success (Technology Commercialization)**
- **Total SBIR Companies**: 33,583
- **Companies with Transitions**: 2,663 
- **Company Success Rate**: **7.9%**

### **üèÜ Award-Level Success (Individual Award Outcomes)**
- **Total SBIR Awards**: 680,935
- **Awards with Transitions**: 469,927
- **Award Success Rate**: **69.0%**

## üîç **Key Insights**

### **1. Award Success vs Company Success**
- **Individual awards** have much higher transition rates (69%) than companies (7.9%)
- This means: **Most SBIR awards lead to follow-on work, but few companies successfully commercialize**

### **2. Phase Differences**
- **Phase II awards**: 74.1% transition rate (191,568 of 258,616)
- **Phase I awards**: 65.9% transition rate (278,359 of 422,319)
- **Phase II is more successful** at leading to commercialization

### **3. Company Distribution Patterns**
- **92.1% of companies** (30,920) have **zero transitions**
- **7.9% of companies** (2,663) have **at least one transition**
- **Successful companies average 176.5 awards** and **176.5 transitions**

### **4. Super-Performers**
- Some companies have **1,000+ transitions** (e.g., Physical Sciences Inc. with 70,311+)
- These represent **serial SBIR performers** with sustained commercialization success

## üí° **Business Implications**

### **For Policy Makers**
1. **Award-level success is high** (69%) - SBIR program effectively generates follow-on work
2. **Company-level success is low** (7.9%) - most companies don't achieve sustained commercialization
3. **Phase II is more effective** - focus resources on Phase II transitions

### **For SBIR Companies**
1. **Most awards transition** - individual projects have good commercialization prospects
2. **Few companies sustain success** - building repeatable commercialization capability is key
3. **Serial performers exist** - some companies master the SBIR-to-commercial pathway

### **For Researchers**
1. **Different metrics tell different stories** - need both perspectives for complete analysis
2. **Distribution is highly skewed** - small number of companies drive large portion of transitions
3. **Phase matters** - Phase II awards are 8.2 percentage points more likely to transition

## üìà **Reporting Framework**

### **Company-Level Questions**
- "What percentage of SBIR companies successfully commercialize their technology?"
- "How many companies achieve sustained SBIR commercialization success?"
- "Which companies are the most successful at SBIR commercialization?"

### **Award-Level Questions**  
- "What percentage of SBIR awards lead to follow-on contracts?"
- "Are Phase II awards more successful than Phase I awards?"
- "How many total SBIR commercialization events occur annually?"

## üéØ **Summary**

**The SBIR program is highly effective at the award level** (69% success rate) but **most companies struggle to achieve sustained commercialization** (7.9% success rate). This suggests the program successfully funds individual projects that lead to follow-on work, but building repeatable commercialization capabilities remains challenging for most SBIR recipients.

**Key Takeaway**: Use **award-level metrics** to measure program effectiveness and **company-level metrics** to identify commercialization champions and understand barriers to sustained success.
